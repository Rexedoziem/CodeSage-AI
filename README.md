## Overview

The Advanced Copilot Language Server is an AI-powered code completion system that provides intelligent, context-aware code suggestions across multiple programming languages. It's designed to integrate seamlessly with various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that support the Language Server Protocol (LSP).

## Features

- **AI-Powered Completions**: Utilizes the LLaMA2 model for generating high-quality code suggestions.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Provides completions for various programming languages.
- **User Authentication**: Secures access and enables personalized suggestions.
- **Context-Aware Completions**: Analyzes the current code context for more relevant suggestions.
- **LSP Integration**: Compatible with any LSP-supporting IDE.
- **Efficient Response Streaming**: Delivers suggestions in real-time as you type.
- **Personalization**: Adapts to individual coding styles and preferences over time.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- At least 8GB of RAM (16GB recommended for optimal performance)
- GPU with CUDA support (optional, for faster processing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-copilot-server.git
   cd advanced-copilot-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

The server uses environment variables for configuration. Set the following variables before running the server:

- `DATABASE_PATH`: Path to the SQLite database file (e.g., "/path/to/user_data.db")
- `SECRET_KEY`: A secure secret key for token encryption (e.g., "your-very-secure-secret-key")
- `MODEL_PATH`: Path to the LLaMA2 model files (e.g., "/path/to/llama2/model")
- `DEVICE`: Computing device to use ("cpu" or "cuda")

Example of setting environment variables:

```bash
export DATABASE_PATH="/home/user/copilot/user_data.db"
export SECRET_KEY="your-very-secure-secret-key"
export MODEL_PATH="/home/user/models/llama2-codegen"
export DEVICE="cpu"
```

## Running the Server

Start the server by running:

```
python server.py
```

The server will start and listen on `localhost:2087` by default.

## Usage

### Connecting to an IDE

1. Open your LSP-compatible IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text).
2. Install the appropriate LSP client extension for your IDE if not already present.
3. Configure the LSP client to connect to `localhost:2087` (or the port you've set).

Example configuration for VS Code (in `.vscode/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "languageServerExample.trace.server": "verbose",
  "languageServerExample.server": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 2087
  }
}
```

### Authentication

1. In your IDE, use the command palette to run `Copilot: Authenticate`.
2. You'll be prompted to enter your credentials or authentication token.
3. Upon successful authentication, you'll receive a confirmation message.

### Getting Code Completions

1. Open a file in a supported programming language.
2. As you type, the server will automatically provide code suggestions.
3. Use your IDE's completion shortcut (often Tab or Enter) to accept a suggestion.

Example:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    count = len(numbers)
    return  # Your cursor here will trigger a completion
```

The server might suggest: `return total / count if count > 0 else 0`

### Customizing Completions

- **Trigger Characters**: By default, completions are triggered after typing "." or a space. You can customize this in the `capabilities()` method of `CopilotLanguageServer`.
- **Completion Style**: The server aims to provide context-aware completions. To get the best results, write clear, well-structured code and add comments explaining your intent.

## Architecture

The Advanced Copilot Language Server consists of several key components:

1. **CopilotLanguageServer**: The core server class that handles LSP communications.
2. **CompletionProvider**: Generates code completions using the LLaMA2 model.
3. **ContextAnalyzer**: Analyzes the current code context for better suggestions.
4. **UserStore**: Manages user data and preferences.
5. **AuthManager**: Handles user authentication and token management.

## Development

To extend or modify the server:

1. Enhance `CopilotLanguageServer` in `server.py` for new LSP features.
2. Modify `CompletionProvider` in `completion_provider.py` to improve suggestion generation.
3. Update `ContextAnalyzer` in `context_analyzer.py` for better code understanding.
4. Add new language support in `language_detector.py`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Model Loading Issues**: Ensure `MODEL_PATH` is correct and the model files are present.
- **Authentication Failures**: Verify `SECRET_KEY` and `DATABASE_PATH` are set correctly.
- **Performance Issues**: If completions are slow, consider using a GPU by setting `DEVICE="cuda"`.
- **IDE Connection Problems**: Check your IDE's LSP client configuration and ensure the server is running.

For more detailed logs, set the `COPILOT_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `DEBUG`.
